# ## Data Analysis with Python
# ### Working with Real World Data Sets
# 
# 
# ### By Olamide Adeyanju

# Welcome to this tutorial on data analysis with Python. This tutorial is a practical guide for beginners to learn how to use Python for data analysis using real world data sets. 
# 
# Prerequisites:
# 
# 1. Python 3.7 via Anaconda Installer ( I recommend this instead of downloading Python 3.7 directly as anaconda comes with the packages you need for data analysis with Python; you can download it through this link: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).
# 
# 2. Some knowledge of python programming: If this is your first time working with python, it is advisable you learn some python basics first; however, this tutorial is designed for beginners, so as long as you can use a computer and have some statistics knowledge, you will learn from this tutorial.
# 
# **Data** : The dataset we will be using is a list of over 7,000 online reviews for 50 electronic products from websites like Amazon and Best Buy provided by Datafiniti's Product Database. The dataset includes the product names, brands, manufacturers, review date, source, rating, title, reviewer metadata, etc.
# To follow this tutorial, you will have to download the data set through this link: https://data.world/datafiniti/amazon-and-best-buy-electronics
# 

# Let's start by importing the libraries we will need for this data analysis.

# In[2]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
get_ipython().system(' pip install seaborn')
import seaborn as sns

from sklearn import preprocessing
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from scipy import stats
import scipy.optimize as opt

get_ipython().system('conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf0202003 wordcloud --yes')
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS
import string
import collections
print ('All libraries imported!')


# **Importing the Dataset**
# 
# Once you complete the data download, read it into a pandas dataframe using the file path as shown in the code below. 
# 
# The dataset is in .csv format, hence we use the pd.read_csv() function, if it was an excel file, we would use pd.read_excel(). 

# In[3]:


df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\USER\Downloads\DatafinitiElectronicsProductData.csv')
df.head()


# The df.head() functions shows the first 5 rows of the dataset as seen in the above output.
# 
# Its time to familiarise ourselves with the data set.
# 

# Let's confirm the size of the dataset imported.

# In[4]:


df.shape


# The output shows that the dataset contains 7299 rows and 27 columns

# Let's check the columns we have so we can select the features useful for this analysis.

# In[5]:


df.columns


# There are quite a number of features not needed based on the aim of this analysis. Let's detect the ones we need and name it df1.

# In[6]:


df1 = df[['id', 'brand', 'categories', 'colors', 'name', 'reviews.date', 'reviews.doRecommend', 'reviews.rating', 'reviews.text']]
df1.head()


# I will love to change a few column names(I don't like have "." in my column names). We would do this using the rename() function:

# In[7]:


df1.rename(columns={'reviews.date':'ReviewDate','reviews.doRecommend':'Recommend', 'reviews.rating':'Rating','reviews.text':'ReviewText'}, inplace=True)
df1.columns


# In[8]:


df1.head()


# Let's confirm the types of the variables.

# In[9]:


df1.dtypes


# Notice the date format of the review date, in order to reduce redundancies, it will be best to have just the year of the review. We can achieve this by first converting the values to datetime type  and then change the format to year only. 

# In[10]:


df1['ReviewDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df1['ReviewDate'])
df1['ReviewDate'] = df1['ReviewDate'].dt.strftime('%Y')
df1.head()


# Let's understand the statistics of our data using the decribe() function:

# In[11]:


df1.describe()


# Now, the describe() function only calculates the statistics of numerical variables i.e type integer or type float, this is why it only gave us the statistics for the ratings as that is the only numerical variable in integer/float type. 
# 
# We can see the average rating is 4.37 hence the ratings in the dataset are mostly positive. We can see the statistics of the other variables by including the 'object' argument as shown below:

# In[12]:


df1.describe(include=['object'])


# We can see the most frquent brand, category, color and product. We can also see that majority of the products were recommended by the users and year 2017 had majority reviews. It is also visible from the counts that variables such as colors, review date, Recommend, 'Rating' and 'ReviewText' have missing values. 
# 
# There are different ways to treat missing/null/NaN values: we can fill them with the mean of the variable values, we can drop them, we can also leave them as it is because sometimes a null value means something. However, for this analysis and based on the peculiarity of this data set, it would be erroneous to fill out missing values as we might end up introducing bias. 
# 
# Hence we will drop them but not now in order not to miss out on important information when we visualize the data. 

# Let's familiarise ourselves with the brands in this dataset and see how they are distributed.

# In[13]:


df1['brand'].value_counts().reset_index()


# We have 38 brands and the top five most frequent ones are Logitech, Sony, Microsoft, JBL, and Samsung.

# Let's compare the average ratings of the brands over the years. We can start by grouping the brands and sorting them according to their average ratings using the groupby() function. But first let's take a slice of the data for brands and their ratings.

# In[14]:


dfbrand=df1[['brand', 'Rating']]
dfbrand.head()


# In[15]:


dfbrand=dfbrand.groupby('brand').mean().reset_index()


# In[16]:


dfbrand.head()


# Let's sort the brands according to their average ratings in descending order.

# In[17]:


dfbrand.sort_values(by=['Rating'], ascending=False)


# We can see that Kicker, SVS, CLARITY-TELECOM, Definitive Technology and Corsair have top average ratings; but if you compare this list with the counts of the brands, you will realise that these brands have single digit frequencies, this is probably the reason for their high average ratings. It would be fair to compare brands with similar frequency counts to avoid bias.
# 
# Based on this, let's compare the ratings of the top 5 most frequent brands which are Logitech, Sony, Microsoft, JBL, and Samsung.
# 
# The next step is to select the data containing information of these brands.

# In[18]:


dfbrand5= dfbrand.loc[dfbrand['brand'].isin(['Logitech','Sony', 'Microsoft', 'JBL', 'Samsung'])]
dfbrand5


# Let's visualize this using a bar plot, however, we would have to set the brand as index first for accurate plot interpretation.

# In[19]:


dfbrand5.set_index('brand', inplace=True)
dfbrand5.head()


# In[20]:


dfbrand5.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(14, 10))
plt.title('Ratings of Top 5 most common Brands')
plt.ylabel('Rating')
plt.xlabel('Brand')

plt.show()


# We can see Microsoft has the best average rating followed by Sony and Samsung. We can also plot the chart as a horizontal bar plot by changing the kind to 'barh' instead of 'bar', we can also change the color of the chart and adjust the size as shown below

# In[21]:


dfbrand5.plot(kind='barh', figsize=(8, 6), color='red')
plt.title('Ratings of Top 5 most common Brands')
plt.ylabel('Brand')
plt.xlabel('Rating')

plt.show()


# Why don't we examine the three top rated brands of this plot (Microsoft, Sony, Samsung) and see the trend of their ratings over the years. We will need the review date variable for this, so we have to slice from the data set the reveiw date, brand and ratings.

# In[22]:


dftrend = df1[['ReviewDate', 'brand', 'Rating']]
dftrend.head()


# To make it easier to select the brands with .loc, let's set the brand as the index and transpose the data.

# In[23]:


dftrend.set_index('brand', inplace=True)
dftrend.head()


# In[24]:


dftrend.transpose()


# Let's start with Microsoft:

# In[25]:


dftrendm=dftrend.loc[['Microsoft']]
dftrendm


# We can see the presence of NaN values, let's drop them first.

# In[26]:


dftrendm = dftrendm.dropna()
dftrendm


# In[27]:


sns.lineplot(y="Rating", x="ReviewDate",data = dftrendm)


# It is interesting to see that Microsoft ratings were on the increase from 2015 to 2016 and then began to drop. As at 2017 it had dropped lower than the point it started with in 2015. Is it possible that there was a problem with their products or there were more competing products from other brands?
# 
# Let's checkout Sony's performance over the years according to this data set:

# In[28]:


dftrendso=dftrend.loc[['Sony']]
dftrendso


# In[29]:


dftrendso = dftrendso.dropna()
dftrendso


# In[30]:


sns.lineplot(y="Rating", x="ReviewDate",data = dftrendso)


# Sony's Ratings appears to be flunctuating over the years. Unlike the Microsoft data, review date ranges from 2007 to 2018 so it gives a good representation of the trend.
# 
# Notice the steep drop in ratings in 2010, it shot up again in 2012 and started dropping again with the lowest drop in 2016 after which it started going up. Based on this plot, the brand manufacturer should watch out for reasons for the drops at different periods in order to mitigate future drops. 
# 
# Lastly, let's examine's Samsung's trend.

# In[31]:


dftrendsa=dftrend.loc[['Samsung']]
dftrendsa


# In[32]:


sns.lineplot(y="Rating", x="ReviewDate",data = dftrendsa)


# This plot shows stable ratings for Samsung from 2014 to circa 2016 after which it started dropping to its lowest in 2017 and then gradually increased.

# There are different ways to visualize data such as Area plots, waffle plots, scatter plots and so much more. Infact I believe each plot type deserves a tutorial. I advise you subscribe to join my mailing list so you can be alerted on my tutorials.

# How about we check the correlation of the variables? It would be great to be able to predict that a product will be recommended based on variables like brand, category, and even ratings. Is there really a relationship between rating and recommendation? We can confirm this using correlation analysis.

# However, correlation analysis can only be done with numerical variables, hence we would have to convert all the variables of interest to numerical variables using the scikit learn label encoder.
# 
# First, let's select the variables we want:

# In[33]:


dfcorr = df1[['brand', 'categories', 'colors', 'Rating', 'Recommend']]
dfcorr


# We would have to drop rows with missing/NaN values. 

# In[34]:


dfcorr=dfcorr.dropna()
dfcorr


# Let's convert them to numerical values except 'Rating' which is already type float.

# In[35]:


le = LabelEncoder() 
dfcorr['brand'] = le.fit_transform(dfcorr['brand'])
dfcorr['categories'] = le.fit_transform(dfcorr['categories'])
dfcorr['colors'] = le.fit_transform(dfcorr['colors'])
dfcorr['Recommend'] = le.fit_transform(dfcorr['Recommend'])
dfcorr


# We can run a correlation analysis on the whole data with a single line of code. This will generate a correlation matrix that will show the strength of correlation between each variable and product recommendation.

# In[36]:


dfcorr.corr()


# We can see that only product ratings had strong correlation with product recommendation with a coefficient of 0.777560. 

# We can also calculate the correlation coefficient and check the P-value (to measure statistical significance) using scipy. Since only rating shows correlation with recommendation, let's first slice out a fresh data set for ratings and recommendation, this is to include rows dropped due to the missing values of other variables.

# In[37]:


dfrr= df1[['Rating', 'Recommend']]
dfrr


# In[38]:


dfrr=dfrr.dropna()
dfrr


# In[39]:


dfrr['Recommend'] = le.fit_transform(dfrr['Recommend'])
dfrr


# In[40]:


pearson_coef, p_value = stats.pearsonr(dfrr['Rating'], dfrr['Recommend'])
print("The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is", pearson_coef, " with a P-value of P =", p_value)  


# The correlation coefficient is still about the same value and a P.Value of 0.0 shows that the strong correlation is statistically significant.

# Let's dive into a bit of Machine Learning, shall we?
# 
# Like I mentioned earlier, it would be great to be able to predict recommendation of products especially as the world becomes more digital. However, most of the variables in these data sets are not correlated with product recommendation except rating.
# 
# This means that if a customer rates a product positively, there is likelihood that he/she will recommend the product to someone else or a potential customer. Let's model the relationship between ratings and recommendation in order to get introduced to machine learning/ regression analysis with Python.
# 
# Because the 'Recommend' variable is binary, i.e, either True(1) or False(0), it is best to use logistic regression.

# Let's start by defining our X (Independent/predictor variable-Rating) and y(Dependent variable - Recommend)

# In[41]:


X = np.asarray(dfrr[['Rating']])
X[0:5]


# In[42]:


y = np.asarray(dfrr['Recommend'])
y [0:5]


# When modelling, it is best to create a train and test set. In simple words, we split the data set into two, use the train set to fit the data and the test set to validate our model. It is expected that our model is able to accurately predict the test set to a large extent .
# 
# I am setting the test data set size at 20% i.e 0.2 as shown in the code below. 
# 
# Random state ensures that the splits that we generate are reproducible. Scikit-learn uses random permutations to generate the splits.

# In[43]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=4)
print ('Train set:', X_train.shape,  y_train.shape)
print ('Test set:', X_test.shape,  y_test.shape)


# Next step is to fit the model using the train data set:

# In[44]:


from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
LR = LogisticRegression(C=0.01, solver='liblinear').fit(X_train,y_train)
LR


# Using the fit model, let's use the test set to predict recommendation:

# In[45]:


yhat = LR.predict(X_test)
yhat[0:5]


# ** Model Evaluation**
# 
# Let's evaluate the model. There are different ways to evaluate a model. For this tutorial, we will use Jaccard Similarity Score and Confusion Matrix.
# 
# **Jaccard Similarity Score** is a statistic used in understanding the similarities between sample sets. In this case it is measuring the similarity between the y test set and the yhat (predicted Recommendation). The more similar the data sets, the higher the percentage of the score or the closer it is to 1.
# 
# **Confusion Matrix** summarises number of correct and incorrect predictions with count values and break them down by each class.

# In[46]:


from sklearn.metrics import jaccard_similarity_score
jaccard_similarity_score(y_test, yhat)


# The Jaccard similarity score is 93.99%, showing that the actual and predicted y data sets are similar. Hence the model is fit.

# Let's try confusion matrix:

# In[47]:


from sklearn import metrics
cnf_matrix = metrics.confusion_matrix(y_test, yhat)
cnf_matrix


# In[48]:


class_names=[0,1] # name  of classes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
tick_marks = np.arange(len(class_names))
plt.xticks(tick_marks, class_names)
plt.yticks(tick_marks, class_names)
# create heatmap
sns.heatmap(pd.DataFrame(cnf_matrix), annot=True, cmap="YlGnBu" ,fmt='g')
ax.xaxis.set_label_position("top")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.title('Confusion matrix', y=1.1)
plt.ylabel('Actual label')
plt.xlabel('Predicted label')


# In[49]:


print("Accuracy:",metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat))
print("Precision:",metrics.precision_score(y_test, yhat))
print("Recall:",metrics.recall_score(y_test, yhat))


# Accuracy is 93.99%, precision is 93.79% and Recall is 100% showing that the model predicts recommendation accurately.

# So now that we see that rating is a good predictor for recommendations, let's examine the review text of positive and negative ratings, maybe we can identify features that can help get electronic products recommended.
# 
# We will do this using the Word cloud library.

# Let's start with positive ratings i.e 4 and 5 star ratings:

# In[50]:


dfrate=df1[['Rating', 'ReviewText']]
dfrate


# Let's drop NaN values

# In[51]:


dfrate=dfrate.dropna()
dfrate


# In[52]:


dfrate['Rating']=dfrate['Rating'].astype(int)
dfrate


# In[53]:


dfpos= dfrate.loc[dfrate['Rating'].isin([4, 5])]
dfpos


# Let's clean the data for the text analysis:
# 
# We start by converting all to lower case to avoid repetitions.

# In[54]:


dfpos['ReviewText']= dfpos['ReviewText'].str.lower()
dfpos['ReviewText'].head()


# Next step is to split.

# In[55]:


dfpos1 = dfpos['ReviewText'].str.split(' ')
dfpos1.head()


# The next step is to join all the 'ReviewText' data in order to be able to work with word cloud.

# In[57]:


dfposcleaned = []

for text in dfpos1:
    text = [x.strip(string.punctuation) for x in text]
    dfposcleaned.append(text)

dfposcleaned[0]

Pos_Rev = [" ".join(text) for text in dfposcleaned]
final_Pos_Rev = " ".join(Pos_Rev)
final_Pos_Rev[:500]


# In[58]:


wordcloud_revpos = WordCloud(background_color="white").generate(final_Pos_Rev)

plt.figure(figsize = (15,15))
plt.imshow(wordcloud_revpos, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()


# The more frequent the word, the larger it is. This word cloud shows that speaker, great, remote are the most frequent in reviews with positve ratings.

# In[59]:


stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)
stopwords.update(["love","great","device","one","good","need", "will", "really", "use","used", "time", "well", "bought"])

wordcloud_revpos = WordCloud(stopwords=stopwords, background_color="white", max_font_size=50, max_words=100).generate(final_Pos_Rev)

plt.figure(figsize = (15,15))
plt.imshow(wordcloud_revpos, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()


# So we can see more functional words like remote, better, nice, headphone, sound, price, speaker, bass, easy. It is safe to say that products with features like good sound, price, good speakers, ease of use, remote controls are more likely to get positive ratings and be recommended. 
# 
# Let's look at negative ratings i.e 1 and 2 star ratings. 

# In[60]:


dfneg= dfrate.loc[dfrate['Rating'].isin([1, 2])]
dfneg


# In[61]:


dfneg['ReviewText']= dfneg['ReviewText'].str.lower()
dfneg['ReviewText'].head()


# In[62]:


dfneg = dfneg['ReviewText'].str.split(' ')
dfneg.head()


# In[63]:


dfnegcleaned = []

for text in dfneg:
    text = [x.strip(string.punctuation) for x in text]
    dfnegcleaned.append(text)

dfnegcleaned[0]

Neg_Rev = [" ".join(text) for text in dfnegcleaned]
final_Neg_Rev = " ".join(Neg_Rev)
final_Neg_Rev[:500]


# In[64]:


wordcloud_revneg = WordCloud(background_color="white", max_font_size=50, max_words=100).generate(final_Neg_Rev)

plt.figure(figsize = (15,15))
plt.imshow(wordcloud_revneg, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()


# Let's remove less meaningful words using stop words

# In[65]:


stopwords2 = set(STOPWORDS)
stopwords2.update(["great","go","use","one","remote", "will", "use","used", "time", "need", "bought"])

wordcloud_revneg = WordCloud(stopwords=stopwords2, background_color="white", max_font_size=50, max_words=100).generate(final_Neg_Rev)

plt.figure(figsize = (15,15))
plt.imshow(wordcloud_revneg, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()


# Features that caused negative ratings were button, harmony, sound, touch, screen. Logitech seems to be popularly mentioned in the reviews with negative ratings. 
# 
# We can also check the most frquent words and read them into a table. In this case the top 20 most common words in reviews with positive and negative ratings.

# In[66]:


filtered_posrev = [word for word in final_Pos_Rev.split() if word not in stopwords]
counted_posrev = collections.Counter(filtered_posrev)

word_count_pos = {}

for letter, count in counted_posrev.most_common(20):
    word_count_pos[letter] = count
    
for i,j in word_count_pos.items():
        print('Word: {0}, count: {1}'.format(i,j))


# We can see that the most frequent word is sound, remote, easy, speaker, works, quality, price, etc.

# Let's repeat the process for negative reviews.

# In[67]:


filtered_negrev = [word for word in final_Neg_Rev.split() if word not in stopwords2]
counted_negrev = collections.Counter(filtered_negrev)

word_count_neg = {}

for letter, count in counted_negrev.most_common(20):
    word_count_neg[letter] = count
    
for i,j in word_count_neg.items():
        print('Word: {0}, count: {1}'.format(i,j))


# ### Conclusion and Recommendation

# Good product ratings increase the likelihood of recommendations. Features like quality sound, ease of use, good speakers, fair prices and something that simply works or does the job with ease would help a product get good ratings and be recommended to another potential customer. 
# 
# Brands like Microsoft, sony and Samsung appear to have generally good ratings, however, it is import that the manufacturers continue to ensure they satisfy the customers and update themselves on new trends through compettion analysis for instance. 
# 
# Wholesalers and retailers can use the results of this data set to know the brands to invest in and features to watch out for.
