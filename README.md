# Data Analysis with Python: Working with Real World Data Sets

## By Olamide Adeyanju

Welcome to this tutorial on data analysis with Python. This tutorial is a practical guide for beginners to learn how to use Python for data analysis using real-world data sets.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7**: It is recommended to install Python via the [Anaconda Installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) as it comes with the necessary packages for data analysis.
- **Basic Python Knowledge**: Familiarity with Python programming is beneficial.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this tutorial consists of over 7,000 online reviews for 50 electronic products from sources such as Amazon and Best Buy, provided by Datafiniti's Product Database. The dataset includes:

- Product names
- Brands
- Manufacturers
- Review date
- Source
- Rating
- Title
- Reviewer metadata

To follow this tutorial, download the dataset [here](https://data.world/datafiniti/amazon-and-best-buy-electronics).

## Libraries Used

The Python libraries used in this tutorial are listed in a separate text file in this repository. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed.

## Project Structure

- **Script**: The main script containing data analysis is the Python file included in the repository.
- **Text File**: Contains the list of libraries used.
    
## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
2. **Install necessary libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r libraries.txt
3. **Run the script:**
 ```bash
   DataAnalysisWithPython.py
```
## Key Concepts and Techniques
- Data Import and Cleaning: Load data using pandas and clean it for analysis.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.Statistical Analysis: Conduct correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables.Machine Learning: Use logistic regression to model and predict product recommendations.Text Analytics: Analyze review sentiments using word clouds.Conclusion and Recommendations
- This analysis demonstrates how product ratings correlate with product recommendations. Focus on features like sound quality, ease of use, and fair pricing to enhance product appeal. Brands like Microsoft, Sony, and Samsung generally show positive ratings, supporting investment decisions for wholesalers and retailers.
